				I had a need recently to modify a Microsoft Forms form. This involved changing quite a few duplicated options in dropdown lists.
				</p>
				<p><strong>The problem </strong>was to verify that all instances of the text had been removed from the dropdowns. </p>
				<p><strong>The answer </strong>was to view the source of the form as JSON, and use the text search of the browser to verify that the text was not in any of the dropdowns.</p>
				
				<p>To do this, you can use the ms form api, from a browser window, in a session where you have already logged in. The url is: <code>https://forms.office.com/formapi/api/forms('-YOUR-FORM-ID-HERE-')?select=id,title,questions&$expand=questions($expand=choices)</code>. This will give you access to all the form schema, including the text for each choice.</p>
