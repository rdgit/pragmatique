				There are a few versions online for this - the lack of a regex in PA flows causes issues!.
				</p>
				<p><strong>The problem </strong>you have a string, with numbers mixed in. You would like to keep these numbers - and convert them to an int. </p>
				<p><strong>My answer </strong>Is in 2 steps - a filter array step, and the join step.</p>

				I had a need recently to modify a Microsoft Forms form. This involved changing quite a few duplicated options in dropdown lists.
				</p>
				<p><strong>The problem </strong>was to verify that all instances of the text had been removed from the dropdowns. </p>
				<p><strong>The answer </strong>was to view the source of the form as JSON, and use the text search of the browser to verify that the text was not in any of the dropdowns.</p>

				<h2><a href="./flow-lookup-merge.html">Power Automate - lookups, matching and dictionaries</a></h2>
				<p class="meta">Posted on: 10 Oct 2024</p>
				<p>In Power Automate, sometimes you have a need to "enrich" one set of objects, with some parameters from another object. This is a remix of a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqcKMUh5JG0">PaulieM video</a>, where he uses XPath to achieve this. I want to explore a way where we use the JSON objects themselves as the lookup.</p>
